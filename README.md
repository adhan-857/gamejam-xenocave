### Game Concept
Xenocave is an intense 2D sci-fi adventure game set deep within an alien cavern. You're an explorer trapped inside a cave system on a distant world, and your only hope of survival lies in finding an escape portal. However, this escape route won't activate until you defeat all lurking alien creatures, including a fierce final boss.

Armed with just a flamethrower, you must carefully manage your limited fuel supply. Fuel regenerates slowly over time, forcing strategic and thoughtful combat decisions. Your health regenerates too, but more gradually, adding another layer of tactical depth.

With detailed environments created through captivating tilemaps, every room holds potential danger. Xenocave will challenge your reflexes, strategy, and resource management. Delivering heart-pounding encounters that keep you hooked and wanting more!<br>
<br>

### Controls
- **Arrow keys (←, →)** to move left and right.
- **Arrow key (↑)** to jump.
- **'E' key** to interact with objects (open doors when you near it, activate teleporters when you stand on it).
- **Spacebar** to fire your flamethrower.<br>

### Diversifier Implementation
- **BOTW Clone:**<br>
Instead of a traditional stamina bar, Xenocave innovatively implements a regenerating fuel mechanic for your flamethrower. Fuel regenerates slowly, requiring careful resource management and tactical gameplay.

- **Boss Fight:**<br>
The game climaxes with an intense final boss encounter that must be defeated to activate the escape portal, pushing players to strategically use all their skills and resources.

- **Tilemap:**<br>
The environments of Xenocave are meticulously designed using tilesets and tilemaps, creating visually appealing and consistent worlds for immersive exploration and seamless navigation.
